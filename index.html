            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a business professional working toward a second career in software development. My dream is to 
                build and deploy business applications that are practical, clean, user-friendly and allow employees 
                to organize and access data efficiently. This passion comes from the many ways that software has helped 
                and hindered me in my day-to-day work life. 
                When I'm not dreaming about ways to make work more organized, I am spending time with my dear husband and beautiful
                children. They are my light and life. I also enjoy reading, skiing, and golfing in my minimal spare time.</p>
